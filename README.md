##This is a POC of SLF4/LOG4J

* The goal is add PID "Process Id" (dummy) to logger.
* The same logic you can use to log for example the user session Id

You can test it from CONSOLE or WEB:
* CONSOLE: print log on command line, run App.java.
* WEB: print log on command line, run jetty server ([http://localhost:8080/poc-logback](http://localhost:8080/poc-logback))
